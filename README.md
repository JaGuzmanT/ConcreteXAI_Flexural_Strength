## Description: üìù
This repository contains a deep neural network model designed to estimate the flexural strength of concrete using the ConcreteXAI dataset. The ConcreteXAI dataset provides comprehensive multivariate data that includes measurements of compressive strength, electrical resistivity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, tensile strength, and flexural strength for various concrete mixtures.

## Project Summary üìö
The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep neural network capable of accurately predicting the flexural strength of concrete samples based on their composition and properties. This model aims to assist researchers and engineers in the civil engineering field by providing a reliable tool for predicting concrete performance.

## Dataset Description üî•
The ConcreteXAI dataset includes the following columns:

Compressive strength (MPa)
Tensile strength (MPa)
Flexural strength (MPa)
Electrical resistivity (Œ©¬∑cm)
Ultrasonic pulse velocity (m/s)
Each row represents a concrete sample, with measurements taken at 3, 7, 14, 28, 40, 60, 90, and 120 days after casting.
